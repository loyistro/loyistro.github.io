Behind this, things continue—like how the shopkeeper, after you leave, will finish their shift and live their own life. It feels both close and distant at the same time, creating a strange sensation, as if you’re looking at someone else’s world from a third-party perspective, with a sense of detachment, almost like an out-of-body experience.\nDaily interactions, on the other hand, feel like chatting with NPCs due to their familiarity.
