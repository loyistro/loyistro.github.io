[{"content":"Most bloggers tend to start their journey by sharing how they set up their site. Thanks to the guidance and shared experiences from others, I managed to piece mine together step by step. Since similar guides are already plentiful, I’ll keep this record brief.\nBlog Framework: Hugo + GitHub Pages + GitHub Actions. Theme： Initially, I was drawn to the minimalist no-style-please theme. With the help of ChatGPT, I customized it to fit my needs and uploaded the modified version to Github. Feel free to use it if you like! Big thanks to AI for helping a zero-code beginner complete my first project. Although I considered learning to build one from scratch, time constraints didn’t allow it. After a few days of effort, I decided to set it aside temporarily and switched to the popular PaperMod theme, which I also tweaked to match my preferences. Font：I borrowed the font and background color from the Maverick Theme and used Bricolage Grotesque from Google Fonts.
