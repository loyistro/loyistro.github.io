  <p>I am a &ldquo;rule follower.&rdquo; I enjoy the sense of order that rules bring because when things are done according to a specific order, the results feel predictable and under control, aligning with my expectations.</p>
<p>However, in the environment I live in, rule violations are still a frequent occurrence.</p>
<p>For instance, while waiting at a red light, motorbikes, bicycles, or pedestrians often cross before the light turns green. When the light changes, the lack of separation between pedestrians and vehicles leads to a chaotic and dangerous mingling of traffic.</p>
<p>Another example occurs near the school gates during drop-off times. Parents bringing their children to school—whether on foot, by motorbike, or by bicycle—crowd onto narrow sidewalks, creating situations just as unsafe as crossing when the light is green.</p>
<p>At first glance, it seems that the lack of proper pedestrian-vehicle separation in public infrastructure causes such chaos. However, I believe there is another underlying reason tied to this environment: the struggle for resources.</p>
<p>There are so many people living here, yet resources like space and other essentials are always in short supply. This scarcity triggers a primal survival instinct—one that persists even in modern society—and manifests in various aspects of daily life.</p>
<p>If I don&rsquo;t run the red light, I might miss something important due to time constraints. If I don’t take the shortcut on the sidewalk, I might have to take a much longer route to reach my destination. There are always countless justifications for breaking the rules.</p>
<p>But it’s the rule-followers who bear the consequences. You might gain a time advantage to accomplish something, but I may face danger or lose the opportunity to cross during the light cycle. As illustrated by this <a href="https://m.weibo.cn/1840483562/5113351388008437">example</a>, this behavior is becoming increasingly common. Even visitors from outside the area quickly develop <a href="https://wellstsai.com/post/mainland-china-work-experiences/">similar impressions</a>.</p>
<p>I believe there’s still much for people here to learn.</p>
