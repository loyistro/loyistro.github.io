  <p>There are a few moments I&rsquo;ve been thinking about.</p>
<p><strong>Moment One</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sitting on a bench at KFC, I put away my phone and waited for my order. Glancing at the electronic sign at the counter, I caught a glimpse of my surroundings out of the corner of my eye. Suddenly, I felt as though I were in a place far from home.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Moment Two</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once, while waiting at a red light, I noticed a garbage truck parked by the side of the road. Perhaps it was the combination of the winter morning, blue sky, and sunlight, but it suddenly felt as if I were in an unfamiliar city.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Describing this feeling is difficult. I’ve thought about it for a long time but haven’t found the right words to express it. Perhaps it’s the novelty of entering a new environment, though it’s not quite the same as a sense of freshness. Instead, it’s a feeling that blends familiarity with unfamiliarity.</p>
<p>The closest connection I can make is to a trip I took to Tokyo earlier this year. I really liked the place, especially its atmosphere. Maybe it’s because it’s an Asian country; even though I was in a different nation with its own culture, people, and customs, I felt a sense of belonging. It seemed like we shared a broader cultural background or similar habits, making everything I saw feel both familiar and unfamiliar at the same time.</p>
<p>Honestly, I&rsquo;m fascinated by this feeling. Gradually, I&rsquo;ve come to define the <em>meaning of travel</em> in my own way.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You arrive at a new place—whether it’s a small village, a narrow road, or a shop you’ve never visited. Every corner you explore, every view you take in, could be both the first and last time you see it. Life continues behind the scenes—like how the shopkeeper, after you leave, will finish their shift and carry on with their own life. It feels both intimate and distant at the same time, creating a strange sensation, as if you’re observing someone else’s world from a third-party perspective. There’s a sense of detachment, almost like an out-of-body experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Daily interactions, on the other hand, often feel like talking to NPCs—familiar and routine. After a few exchanges, it’s over, with no thought about what comes next.</p>
<p>I believe I should change this mindset.</p>
