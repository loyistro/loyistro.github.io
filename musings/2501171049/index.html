  <p>Twelve years ago, I wrote a journal entry about the Norwegian people planning to open a 100-year-old package. Thanks to the internet, you can still find some of the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrisbarth/2012/08/24/norways-100-year-old-mystery-package-opened-guess-what-was-inside/">reports</a> from that time.</p>
<p>What fascinates me now is that rereading my journal feels like opening a package of its own. Though the time span isn’t as long, the fact that I wrote it makes the experience feel like a conversation with my past self. Perhaps this is the true charm of keeping records.</p>
<p>Hope you enjoy it too.</p>
<hr>
<p>On August 24, 2012, something rather fascinating happened—though it may have flown under the radar for most people: a small town in Norway decided to open a package that had been sealed for a hundred years, exactly on schedule.</p>
<p>It felt like a real-life version of a time capsule. Honestly, I had my doubts about such things actually happening. Preserving anything for a century is no small feat. Even the classic trope from movies, novels, or anime—where a group of kids buries a few mementos under a tree, vowing to dig them up as adults—seems difficult to realize in the real world.</p>
<p>So, when I heard about this two days ago, my first reaction was how heartwarming it felt. Regardless of what was inside, it was remarkable to see a scenario we often imagine or hear about in stories come to life.</p>
<p>Naturally, most people were curious about what might be inside the package. The scheduled opening was set for 1 a.m. the night before, but it ended up starting half an hour earlier. I didn’t watch the live video stream but quietly followed updates on Weibo. As expected, moments like this are rarely as straightforward as they seem. Looking back, it’s clear just how much fun the Norwegian people were having.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A proper unboxing ceremony turned into an entire arts performance. I get it now—Norwegians just needed an excuse to throw a cultural gala.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As one commenter put it. The actual unboxing turned out to be just a small part of the event. Once they opened the package, they quickly put it aside and continued with the performances.</p>
<p>In hindsight, I’m glad I didn’t stay up all night watching the live stream—otherwise, I might’ve ended up laughing through the night.</p>
<p>To be fair, the Norwegian people had their reasons for organizing it this way. Simply put, the unboxing was a secondary event. The real purpose of the evening was to commemorate a historic battle in Norwegian history. For more details, see <a href="http://www.guokr.com/blog/322683/">here</a> (Although, reviewing this diary 12 years later, the link has already expired. It’s a reminder that things on the internet are not permanent either—but that’s a topic for another day.)</p>
<p>Back to the package itself—its contents mainly consisted of papers, notebooks, telegrams, and newspapers, along with a stack of scarves that were likely gifts from the king to the package’s owner. There were no scandalous photos of the king, no ship tickets, no instructions for building a time machine, no treasure maps, and no sequel to the Mayan calendar—just ordinary items that, at most, hold historical value today. Even the current Norwegian mayor commented, &ldquo;The contents of the package… haven&rsquo;t solved our financial problems, but they have enriched our history.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many people were disappointed—I, too, was hoping for something unusual. But the fact that this package survived a century unscathed is extraordinary in itself. At the very least, it proves that creating a time capsule is indeed possible. Our curiosity about this event comes from how little we know about the world of a hundred years ago. This package, as a vessel of memory, becomes an incredibly valuable piece of history, connecting us to a time long past.</p>
<p>Just as we love reminiscing about the past, many memories are tied to a medium—be it an object, a building, a scent, or a song. An ordinary thing can encapsulate all our memories and emotions associated with it. In fact, relying solely on our minds to preserve thoughts is often the quickest way to lose them.</p>
<p>We are not Norwegians and may not fully grasp Norway&rsquo;s history or the true significance of this package. Yet, we can vaguely appreciate its meaning. Imagine if this package were an artifact from our own country, perhaps something left behind by Sun Yat-sen. We, too, would have high expectations, wondering what intriguing secrets it might hold. But once opened, if it contained only small, mundane items, we would likely feel disappointed—much as many felt about the Norwegian package. Perhaps only historians would find such objects meaningful.</p>
<p>To date, no official explanation has been given regarding the significance of the items in the package. All we have is the process of its unsealing. What happens next is likely irrelevant to us ordinary internet users; experts will take it from here. The brief wave of speculation and imagination among online users has run its course, though the result didn&rsquo;t match the fantasies they envisioned.</p>
<p>Perhaps we should realize that simply being part of this event is something worth appreciating. Countless events unfold every day, but it&rsquo;s impossible to predict how we&rsquo;ll feel about them years down the line. If the Norwegian package had been lost along the way, this entire chain of events would never have occurred. But how can we ever know what the future holds?</p>
<p>Meaning only reveals itself when rooted in history, and it&rsquo;s unique to each individual. A hundred years from now, what kind of package would you choose to leave behind?</p>
