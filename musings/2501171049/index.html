  <p>Twelve years ago, I wrote a journal entry about the Norwegian people planning to open a 100-year-old package. Thanks to the internet, you can still find some of the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrisbarth/2012/08/24/norways-100-year-old-mystery-package-opened-guess-what-was-inside/">reports</a> from that time.</p>
<p>What I find interesting is that rereading my journal now feels like opening a package of its own. Although the time span isn’t as long, the fact that I wrote it makes the experience feel like a conversation with my past self. Perhaps this is the charm of keeping records.</p>
<p>Hope you enjoy it too.</p>
<hr>
<p>On the 2012/08/24, something quite interesting happened—though perhaps not many people paid attention to it: a small town in Norway decided to open a package that had been sealed a hundred years ago, right on schedule.</p>
<p>It sounds like a real-life version of a time capsule. Honestly, I didn’t quite believe such things could actually happen. After all, preserving something for such a long time is incredibly difficult. Even the classic trope from movies, novels, or anime—where a group of kids buries a few items under a tree and promises to retrieve them as adults—seems hard to pull off in reality.</p>
<p>So, when I heard about this two days ago, my first reaction was that it felt quite heartwarming. Regardless of what was inside, it’s fascinating to see a scenario we often hear about in little stories actually happening in real life.</p>
<p>Of course, most people were curious about what might be inside the package. The scheduled opening was at 1 a.m. the night before, but it ended up starting half an hour earlier. I didn’t watch the live video stream but quietly followed the latest updates on Weibo. As expected, moments like this are never as straightforward as one might imagine. Looking back on it later, you’d realize just how much fun the Norwegian people were having.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A proper unboxing ceremony turned into an entire arts performance. I get it now—Norwegians just needed an excuse to throw a cultural gala.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As one commenter put it. The actual unboxing was just a small segment, and once they opened it, they immediately put it away and continued with the performances.</p>
<p>So, I’m actually pretty glad I didn’t stay up all night watching the live stream—otherwise, I might’ve laughed the whole night.</p>
<p>But to be fair, the Norwegian people had their reasons for organizing it this way. Simply put, the unboxing was just a secondary event. The real purpose of the evening was to commemorate a historic battle in Norwegian history. For more details in <a href="http://www.guokr.com/blog/322683/">here</a> (When reviewing this diary 12 years later, the link has already expired. Things on the internet are not permanent either, but that’s a topic for another day.)</p>
<p>Back to the package itself—its contents were mainly papers, notebooks, telegrams, and newspapers, along with a stack of scarves that were likely gifts from the king to the package’s owner. There were no scandalous photos of the king, no ship tickets, no instructions for building a time machine, no treasure maps, and no sequel to the Mayan calendar—just ordinary items that, at best, hold historical value today. Even the current Norwegian mayor remarked, &ldquo;The contents of the package… haven&rsquo;t solved our financial problems, but they have enriched our history.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many people were disappointed—I was also hoping for something unusual inside. But the fact that this package survived a century unscathed is extraordinary in itself. At the very least, it proves that a time capsule is indeed feasible. Our curiosity about this event stems from the blank slate that the world of a hundred years ago represents in our understanding. The memories evoked through this package as a medium make it an incredibly valuable piece of history.</p>
<p>Just as we love reminiscing about the past, many memories are attached to a medium—whether it’s an object, a building, a scent, or a song. An ordinary thing can carry all our memories and emotions related to it. In fact, keeping thoughts solely in our minds is often the quickest way to erase them.</p>
<p>We are not Norwegians, and we don’t understand Norway’s history or the true significance of this package. However, we can still vaguely appreciate its meaning. Suppose this package were an item from within our own country, perhaps something left behind by our founding father, Sun Yat-sen. We would still have expectations, just like the curiosity people had about the Norwegian package—wondering what intriguing things it contained. But once opened, if it turned out to be just small, trivial items, we would feel disappointed as well. Perhaps only historians would find it interesting.</p>
<p>To this day, there has been no official explanation of the significance of the items in the package. All we have is the process of opening it. What happens next is likely irrelevant to us ordinary internet users; the experts will take over. The brief moment of speculation by online users has been satisfied, though the result was not the answer they had imagined.</p>
<p>Perhaps we should understand that being part of this event itself is already something to look forward to. So many things happen every day, yet it’s impossible to predict what emotions we’ll feel when looking back years later. If this Norwegian package had been lost along the way, perhaps none of this chain of events would have happened. But how can we know what the future holds?</p>
<p>Meaning only becomes apparent when it is anchored in history, and it differs for each person. A hundred years from now, what kind of package would you want to leave behind?</p>
