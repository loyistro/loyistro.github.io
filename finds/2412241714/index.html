  <p>There are a few moments I’ve been thinking about:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sitting on a bench at KFC, putting away my phone and waiting for my order, I glanced at the electronic sign at the counter. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the surroundings and suddenly felt like I was in a place far from home.</li>
<li>Once, while waiting for the red light, I saw a garbage truck parked by the side of the road. Perhaps it was the winter morning, blue sky, and sunlight, but it suddenly felt like being in an unfamiliar city.</li>
</ol>
<p>Describing this feeling is difficult. I’ve thought about it for a long time but haven’t found the right way to express it. Maybe it’s the novelty of entering a new environment, but it’s not quite the same as freshness. Instead, it’s a feeling that blends familiarity with unfamiliarity.</p>
<p>The closest connection I can make is from a trip I took to Tokyo earlier this year. I really liked the place, including its atmosphere. Maybe because it’s an Asian country, even though I’m in a different nation with its own culture, people, and customs, I felt a sense of belonging. It felt like we share a broader cultural background or similar habits, so everything I saw felt both familiar and unfamiliar at the same time.</p>
<p>Honestly, I’m fascinated by this feeling. Gradually, I’ve come to define the <em>meaning of travel</em> in my own way.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You know when you find yourself in a new place—whether it’s a small village, a narrow road, or a shop you’ve never visited. Every corner you explore, every view you take in, could be both the first and the last time you see it. Behind this, things continue—like how the shopkeeper, after you leave, will finish their shift and live their own life. It feels both close and distant at the same time, creating a strange sensation, as if you’re looking at someone else’s world from a third-party perspective, with a sense of detachment, almost like an out-of-body experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Daily interactions, on the other hand, feel like chatting with NPCs because of their familiarity. After a few exchanges, it’s over, and there’s no thought about what comes next.</p>
<p>I think I should change this state of mind.</p>
