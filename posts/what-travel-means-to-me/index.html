  <p>There are a few scenes that I’ve been replaying in my head lately:</p>
<p><strong>Scene 1</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sitting on a stool at KFC, putting away my phone while waiting for my food, staring at the digital menu board up front. Out of the corner of my eye, I catch glimpses of the surroundings, and suddenly it hits me—like I’m in some random place far from home.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Scene 2</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>One time, waiting at a red light, I spotted a garbage truck parked by the roadside. Maybe it was the winter morning vibe, with blue skies and sunlight mixing in, but that combo gave me this weird feeling—like I was in a strange city I’d never been to before.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How do you even describe this feeling? It’s not exactly easy. I’ve thought about it for ages and still can’t pin it down perfectly. Maybe it’s that curiosity you get when you’re in a new place, where everything around you feels kind of novel—but it’s not just “new.” It’s this mix of familiar and strange all tangled up together.</p>
<p>The closest connection I can think of is that trip I took to Tokyo, Japan, at the start of the year. I loved that place—everything about it, the vibe included. Maybe it’s because I’m in an Asian country myself, so even though I was in a different nation with different cultures, people, and habits, there’s still this sense that I’m part of the same broader group. Like, our lifestyles are close enough that what I saw felt both familiar and foreign at the same time.</p>
<p>Honestly, I’m kind of obsessed with this feeling. More and more, I think it’s my own definition of what “travel” means to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You show up in a new place—maybe a tiny village, a quiet road, a random shop. Every corner you’ve been to, every glance you take, could be the first and last time you see it. And behind it all, life goes on—like after you leave, the shop clerk clocks out and goes back to their own world. It’s so close yet so far, and that creates this weirdly cool vibe. It’s like you’re watching someone else’s life through a third-person lens, almost like an out-of-body déjà vu.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But in my everyday life? It’s way too familiar. It’s like I’m chatting with NPCs—same old back-and-forth a few times, and it’s over. I don’t even bother wondering what happens “after.”</p>
<p>I think it’s about time I shake things up.</p>
