  <p>Twelve years ago, I jotted down a diary entry about the Norwegians planning to crack open a 100-Year-Old Postal Package. Thanks to the internet, you can still find some old <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrisbarth/2012/08/24/norways-100-year-old-mystery-package-opened-guess-what-was-inside/">reports</a> from that time.</p>
<p>What’s really cool is that revisiting my diary now feels like opening a little time capsule of my own. Even though it’s only been a dozen years, reading my own words feels like having a heart-to-heart with my younger self. That’s the beauty of keeping a record.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the 24th<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, something pretty cool happened, though it might’ve flown under the radar for a lot of people: a small town in Norway decided to crack open a century-old package.</p>
<p>It’s like a real-life time capsule moment. Honestly, I never really bought into the idea that something like this could actually happen—keeping something intact for 100 years is no joke. Even though it’s a classic trope in movies, books, and anime—you know, the whole “bury something as a kid and dig it up as an adult” thing—it’s hard to picture it playing out in real life.</p>
<p>So when I heard about this the other day, my first thought was, “That’s kinda heartwarming.” Regardless of what’s inside, it’s still pretty wild to see such a classic story come to life.</p>
<p>Of course, most folks were more curious about what was in the package. The big reveal was supposed to go down at 1 a.m. the night before, but they bumped it up by half an hour. I didn’t catch the live stream, but I was glued to Guokr’s Weibo for updates. As expected, these “big moments” never go as planned. Looking back, it’s clear the Norwegians were having a blast. “What started as a solemn package-opening ceremony turned into a full-blown cultural performance. Let’s be real, the Norwegians just wanted an excuse to throw a party” (a netizen’s comment). The actual opening was just a small part of the event, and after they peeked inside, they quickly put it back and carried on with the show. Honestly, I’m glad I didn’t watch the whole thing live, or I might’ve died laughing.</p>
<p>But seriously, the Norwegians had their reasons for doing it this way. The package opening was more of a side show—the real deal was the evening’s commemoration of a historic battle in Norway. For more details: <a href="http://www.guokr.com/blog/322683/">http://www.guokr.com/blog/322683/</a> <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>As for the package itself, it mainly contained some paper documents, notebooks, telegrams, and newspapers, along with a stack of scarves that were likely a gift from the king at the time to the package’s owner. No scandalous photos of the king, no ship tickets, no time machine blueprints, no treasure maps, no sequel to the Mayan calendar—just ordinary items that now hold only historical value. Even the current mayor of Norway said, “The contents of the package… didn’t solve our financial problems, but they’ve enriched our history.”</p>
<p>A lot of folks were disappointed, and I too had hoped for something more extraordinary. But the fact that this package survived a century of turmoil is itself pretty remarkable. At the very least, it proves that time capsules can actually work. Our curiosity about this event comes from the fact that the world a hundred years ago is a blank slate in our minds, and this package serves as a valuable medium for connecting us to that past.</p>
<p>Just like how we love to reminisce about the past, our memories often need a medium to latch onto—whether it’s an object, a building, a scent, or a song. Even an ordinary item can carry all our memories and emotions tied to it. Ironically, just keeping thoughts in our heads is the quickest way to forget them.</p>
<p>We’re not Norwegians, and we don’t fully understand their history or the true significance of this package. But we can still get a sense of it through some general interpretation. Imagine if this package were an item left by Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of our country. We’d probably feel the same anticipation as the netizens did for the Norwegian package, curious about what might be inside. But once opened, we’d likely find just a collection of trivial items and feel equally disappointed—though historians might still find value in them.</p>
<p>As of now, there’s no official explanation of what the items in the package truly signify. All we have is the process of opening it. What happens next likely has little to do with ordinary netizens like us; it’s up to the experts now. The netizens’ burst of imaginative speculation has been satisfied, even if the outcome didn’t match their wildest hopes.</p>
<p>Maybe we should realize that simply being part of this event is something to look forward to. Every day, countless ordinary things happen, and you can never predict how they’ll be remembered years from now. If this Norwegian package had been lost along the way, none of this would have happened. But who knows what the future holds?</p>
<p>Meaning is something that emerges through history, and it’s different for everyone. A hundred years from now, what kind of package would you want to leave behind?</p>
