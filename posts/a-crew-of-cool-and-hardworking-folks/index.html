  <p>Because I occasionally stumble upon Lee Kwangsoo’s clips on Bilibili, I ended up binge-watching <em>Green Bean, Red Bean</em> and its spin-off <em>CAFETARIA OPERATION</em>. Then, thanks to the algorithm, I got recommended the year-end stage performance of the &ldquo;Earth Arcade&rdquo; sisters. Their names kept popping up in the previous shows, so I decided to catch up on the entire series. To my surprise, it gave me some of the best laughs I’ve had in ages.</p>
<p>I don’t watch a ton of Korean variety shows, but the one I’ve consistently followed is <em>Running Man</em>. It motivated me a lot in the past few years and helped me get a glimpse into the Korean entertainment industry, though it’s no secret that the show has been on a bit of a decline lately.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Earth Arcade&rdquo; sisters have all made appearances on <em>Running Man</em> before. I checked the episode list and timeline:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aug 2020: Lee Young-ji appeared on <em>Running Man</em> E514</li>
<li>Aug 2021: Lee Young-ji appeared on <em>Running Man</em> E567</li>
<li>Sep 2021: Lee Young-ji appeared on <em>Running Man</em> E571</li>
<li>Jun 2022: <em>Earth Arcade 1</em> premiered</li>
<li>Jan 2023: Ahn Yu-jin appeared on <em>Running Man</em> E639</li>
<li>May 2023: <em>Earth Arcade 2</em> premiered</li>
<li>Oct 2023: Mimi appeared on <em>Running Man</em> E677</li>
<li>Mar 2024: Lee Eun-ji appeared on <em>Running Man</em> E694</li>
<li>May 2024: Ahn Yu-jin appeared on <em>Running Man</em> E705</li>
<li>May 2024: <em>Earth Arcade&rsquo;s Vroom Vroom</em> premiered</li>
</ul>
<p>Except for Lee Young-ji’s first appearance on <em>Running Man</em>, which felt somewhat interesting, the others didn’t leave a strong impression on me, maybe the different show formats didn’t give them much room to shine, and I’m not exactly a follower of the Korean entertainment scene. So, years later, it’s pretty wild to see these people come together and create such a fantastic show.</p>
<p>There are two main reasons I wanted to jot this down. First, Na Young-seok’s team gives off such a great vibe, which I started to notice while watching <em>CAFETARIA OPERATION</em>. It was my first time watching his variety show, and throughout the episodes, I kept seeing comments adding context. For people my age, the workplace environment we dream of is one where a group of interesting individuals come together and work toward a common goal. At least, that’s the scene I envision.</p>
<p>The second point is something Lee Young-ji mentioned during a break in the latter half of <em>Earth Arcade 2</em>. She said something along the lines of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we meet once a year, and if the show can run for ten years, by then I’ll be 31. It feels like <em>Earth Arcade</em> is like a festival—a place where, after a year of hard work, you come back to be praised or comforted. Each year, we grow closer, and to get even closer next year, we have to work really hard. If we can grow every year and inspire each other, that would be great.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My first reaction was admiration for her youthful courage. But upon further reflection, it’s the same idea I mentioned earlier: &ldquo;a group of interesting people coming together to work toward a common goal.&rdquo; The entire production team has such a comfortable atmosphere, and both sides are helping each other grow. It’s a dynamic I truly envy.</p>
<p>After the show, I watched a behind-the-scenes interview about how the four members were cast. It mentioned that Mimi was recommended by one of the PD’s wives, who noticed her YouTube channel where she showed her real, makeup-free self. She edited the videos herself, and as an idol, it was surprising to see her making desserts.</p>
<p>I went back to watch her earliest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7g8mINglDY">video</a>, a vlog starting from when she woke up. What caught my attention was how her background looked like a typical rented apartment—clothes hanging haphazardly, a simple wooden bed, almost like a small single room. I did the math, and she was probably around 22 or 23 at the time, just starting out in her career. Like an ordinary person, she put in a lot of effort to showcase herself and be seen, which led to new opportunities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just like an ordinary person&rdquo;—when I think about it in the context of Young-ji’s words, it’s quite moving. Celebrities are, after all, ordinary people too, just trying to make a living.</p>
<p>It’s really nice to see a show like this and the people behind it.</p>
