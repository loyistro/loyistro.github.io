  <p>I’m a “rule follower.” I love the sense of order that rules bring because when you do things according to a certain structure, you feel confident about the outcome—it won’t spiral beyond what you expect.</p>
<p>But in the environment I’m in, I still constantly see people breaking the rules.</p>
<p>For example, at traffic lights, you’ve got motorcycles, bikes, and pedestrians jumping the red light before it’s their turn. And when the light turns green, there’s no separation between people and vehicles—everyone’s just mixed together, pushing through in a chaotic and risky mess.</p>
<p>Then there’s the area near the school entrance. During drop-off hours, parents are sending their kids to school, and you’ve got people walking, riding motorcycles, or biking—all crammed onto this narrow pedestrian path. It’s no safer than the green-light situation.</p>
<p>It sounds like a lot of this chaos comes from public facilities not being designed with proper separation for people and vehicles. But I think there’s more to it than that—it’s tied to this environment and the scramble for resources.</p>
<p>There are just so many people living here, and resources like space—or anything you can think of—always fall short of the demand. This primal “survival instinct” kicks in, bursting out from deep inside. Even though we’re not in some ancient society anymore, it still shows up in modern life, everywhere you look.</p>
<p>If I don’t run the red light, I might be late and face some consequences. If I don’t take the pedestrian path as a shortcut, I might have to go the long way around to get where I’m going. There’s always a reason to ditch the rules.</p>
<p>But the ones who get screwed? The people who do follow the rules. Sure, you gain a time advantage to get stuff done, but I’m the one left dealing with the danger or missing my chance to cross the light. It’s like the unhealthy competition among Chinese manufacturing factories described in this <a href="https://m.weibo.cn/1840483562/5113351388008437">example</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A few e-commerce platforms in China, ever since PDD and the like popped up, have dragged the whole industry into a brutal price war. It’s fine when it stays within reason, but once it spirals out of control, you’re not just slashing prices—you’re screwing over people’s lives.</p>
<p>It’s the lives of factory workers, the average Joe grinding away. All that “wool” you think you’re shearing from these deals? It’s really the blood of regular folks. But people vote with their feet, and a lot of these platforms are just playing the game of human nature. They know exactly how to tap into the dark side of people and get the masses to buy in.</p>
<p>Then these platforms go global, with fancy slogans about “bringing Chinese manufacturing to the world.” But let’s be real—everyone who gets it knows the truth. It’s a freaking nightmare. You’re crushing factories and merchants to death back home, where only the worst of the worst survive. And when you go overseas? You’re not helping Chinese factories or brands rake in cash—hell no, you’re just squeezing them harder, MD.</p>
<p>China’s fast-moving consumer brands these days? TMD, they’re basically all about throwing money at the problem upfront, fighting price wars to claw their way up. Good platforms might nurture brands; trash ones just choke them out. Forget making money off foreigners—harsh truth is, you can’t even beat your own people at this game.</p>
<p>Don’t even talk about R&amp;D for products. First, you’ve gotta survive the traffic gauntlet—buying flow, selling through it, then dealing with platforms taking their cut. And after that cut, you’re still stuck with unfair terms. It’s a combo punch that leaves you running on fumes, with hemorrhoids flaring up from the stress.</p>
<p>Our whole industry’s got zero clue about building brands. It’s like we’ve got some kind of PTSD—everyone’s got a trigger response now, and it’s pushing us to crazy extremes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is turning into a widespread thing now. Even outsiders pick up on it the moment they arrive, like in this <a href="https://wellstsai.com/en/post/mainland-china-work-experiences/">take</a>.</p>
<p>I feel like there’s still a lot for people here to learn.</p>
